Codes for SMS assembly 80x86
SMS - SIMULATOR

Microcontroller Simulator
This simulator emulates an eight bit CPU that is similar to the low eight bits of the 80x86 family of chips. 256 bytes of RAM are simulated. It is surprising how much can be done with only 256 bytes or RAM.

Features

8 bit CPU
16 Input Output ports. Not all are used.
Simulated peripherals on ports 0 to 5.
An assembler.
On-line help.
Single step through programs.
Continuously run programs.
Interrupt 02 triggered by a hardware timer (simulated).
CPU Clock Speed can be altered.

<p align="left"><strong>Download for Win32 - Win95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Windows 7</strong> - Not tested with Vista but it probably works.</p>
<p align="left">This program does not need to be installed as it makes no regristry changes. Just extract the files into a folder and make your own shortcut to the EXE file. This also allows it to be run from a network share. Copy it to the network once and run it anywhere on the network. One day, all software will be like this. You might  need a mapped drive.</p>
